  </header>

  <p><strong>MADCSS</strong> stands for <strong>M</strong>odular <strong>A</strong>ttribute-<strong>D</strong>riven <strong>CSS</strong>. Yeah, sooo clever. Basic architecture is <del>based on</del> inspired by: <a href="https://amcss.github.io/">AMCSS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/colepeters/gemma">Gemma</a>, <a href="http://krasimir.github.io/organic-css/">Organic CSS</a>, <a href="http://demo.patternlab.io">Atomic Design</a> and <a href="http://tachyons.io/">Tachyons</a>.</p>

  <p>The base global prefix for all attribute modules is <code>i-</code>, as in "interface".</p>

  <h3><a name="toc-madcss-naming" href="#toc-toc">&uarr;</a> Naming things</h3>

  <p>Attribute names are defined in a simple fashion: attribute always starts with the global prefix, followed by module name. If it's a child, then it appends a double hyphen, followed by the child name. Both parent and child names are written with <code>catepillar-case</code> And try not going deeper than 2 levels with that: i.e. grandchildren and further are forbidden.</p>

  <pre><code>{{ '<prefix>-<parent-name>[--<child-name>]' | xml_escape }}</code></pre>

    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> uppercase letters in attribute names are invalid HTML and can cause bugs in some browsers (as most browsers tend to auto-fix that problem in your code).</p>

    <p>Modifiers are a space-separated strings, so basically you can use any character you want (except space of course):</p>

    <pre><code>{{ '<div i-void--friedrich-nietzsche="2/3 isDead +_- żółć 鸡汤">…</div>' | xml_escape }}</code></pre>

    <p>And then you would write something like this in your <code>.(s)css</code> file:</p>

    {% capture example1 %}{% include docs/madcss/madcss-css-example.css %}{% endcapture %}
    <pre><code>{{ example1 | xml_escape }}</code></pre>

    <h3><a name="toc-madcss-architecture" href="#toc-toc">&uarr;</a> Architecture</h3>

    <p>There are literally five mandatory files you need -- the rest are custom modules (you can delete existing ones, just don't tell me about it). Building new things happens in <code>modules/</code> directory and you will define global variables in -- wait for it -- <code>variables.css</code>! GASP!</p>

    {% capture example2 %}{% include docs/madcss/madcss-architecture-example.txt %}{% endcapture %}
    <pre><code>{{ example2 | xml_escape }}</code></pre>

    <p>As for variables, make sure that you define module private ones in the <code>:root {}</code> block on top of the file. If multiple modules use a variable, you should put in in global file.</p>

    <p>The <code>setup/</code> dir contains some resets for the whole project and simple typography normalisations.</p>

    <p>Modules can be either structure- and layout-related selectors that do one, generic thing extremely well -- or a context-specific selectors for distinct components of an interface. They can be naturally mixed with each other -- as long as it makes sense of course. And if you need a humongous module, create a separate <code>modules/moduleName/</code> directory with same name as module and include all partials in <code>modules/moduleName/moduleName.css</code> file.</p>

    <h3><a name="toc-madcss-quirks" href="#toc-toc">&uarr;</a> Quirks and rules</h3>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Colors Purity</strong> -- the thing I am passionately crazy about: define new colors <em>only</em> inside <code>variables.css</code> to assure your design is not "50 shades of gray". Also try learning some proper words for naming them: like "amaranth" is much better than "redLight2".</li>

      <li><strong>The Leading Principle</strong> -- we want <em>all</em> of the elements, texts and empty spaces to be a multiplication of leading size (<code>line-height</code> of root element in CSS). That way, we assure things look beautiful and we avoid the issue of "50 shades of margins" (yes, I don't know much jokes).</li>

      <li><strong>Inverse Swiss Army knife</strong> -- avoid creating too diverse modules with plenty of modifiers, as it will be hell to maintain. In this instance I would prefer to make them a bit DRY instead. You can also try creating a "shared module" or go with some <code>@mixin</code> if you'd use SASS.</li>
